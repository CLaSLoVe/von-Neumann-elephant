  abstract = {We construct an elementary equation f{\texttheta}(x) with a single real valued parameter {\texttheta} {$\in$} [0, 1] that, as {\texttheta} varies, is capable of fitting any scatter plot on any number of points to within a fixed precision. Specifically, given {$\epsilon$} \&gt; 0, we may construct f{\texttheta} so that for any collection of ordered pairs \{(xj,yj)\}j=0n with n,xi{$\in$}N and yi {$\in$} (0, 1), there exists a {\texttheta} {$\in$} [0, 1] giving {\textbar}f{\texttheta}(xj) - yj{\textbar} \&lt; {$\epsilon$} for all j simultaneously. To achieve this, we apply results about the logistic map, an iterated map in dynamical systems theory that can be solved exactly. The existence of an equation f{\texttheta} with this property highlights that ``parameter counting'' fails as a measure of model complexity when the class of models under consideration is only slightly broad.},
