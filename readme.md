# von Neumann's Elephant 🐘✨

Welcome to the repository for fitting an elephant with four parameters! Inspired by Enrico Fermi’s famous critique, this project dives into the mathematical challenge with a fun and colorful twist. 🌈

## 📜 Introduction

In 1953, Enrico Fermi criticized Dyson’s model by quoting Johnny von Neumann: "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." 🐘 So far, there have been several attempts to fit an elephant using four parameters, but as the problem has not been well-defined, the current methods do not really satisfy the requirements. This paper defines the problem and presents an attempt. 🌟

### 📚 Previous Work

- **Wei (1975)**: Used Fourier series to fit an elephant, requiring over 20 parameters for a reasonably good fit. ✏️🐘
- **Mayer et al. (2010)**: Claimed to fit an elephant using four complex numbers (eight parameters in total). 🎨🐘
- **Piantadosi (2018)**: Proposed a one-parameter solution that essentially encodes the shape into a real number with high precision. 🔢🐘

## 🚀 Our Approach
